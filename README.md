# PowerMacSerial
Serial breakout for several Power Macintosh models

I've never tested, or even built this thing, even though I intended to. It was prototyped using a discarded Mac modem, so there's no reason (barring perhaps me screwing up) it shouldn't work.

If using USB port, please install two 0805 MLCC capacitors marked 47uF 10V, between the VBus trace and ground (duh). I may update gerbers later to make this clearer.!

Also included are gerbers for a small miniDIN Mac-style RS422 breakout, should you want to use that instead of a ready-made pigtail. Mechanicals/attachment methods are up to you.
